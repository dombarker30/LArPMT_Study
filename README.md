This the directory for the analysis code for the Purity study of the liquid argon rig. This is discribed below.

Make sure you in a runx directory to run this code.

For questions email: dominic.barker@sheffield.ac.uk

Here is a description of the code in the directory: 

CreateAvg.sh (run with sh CreateAvg.sh): This creates the root files containing the waveform and header information and averages and performs a fits. Each step only occurs if the file required exist and the file has not already been created. 

RUN_DAQ.sh (run with sh RUN_DAQ.sh): This runs the daq acquisition with the config described in params.txt. It repeatly up to a certain time. One can add there email addresss to get updates fromt the DAQ progress using email_DAQ.py. Individual runs can be run via $HOME/AgMD2_GPM/runGPM

email_DAQ.py: Used in RUN_DAQ.sh to send a email updating you on the status of the DAQ.

waveform.cc (run with ./waveform 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 (Set each channel to 0 which you are not using (6 is the raw pmt)): Creates a root file contain the peak time, peak height and the waveforms for each event. To build use: "make clean; make"   

params.txt: Holds the config file for the DAQ.

dataAveraging.cc (run with ./dataAveraging waveforms_in.root fileout.root): Averages over all the events in the file and provides multiple fits. See Lohans Documentation for more detail.

Updates:

02.08.2018: First GitSetup. Prevously using adhoc DAQ code from the GPM tests. I have added simple scripts to maintain the runs and provide warnings. I have also added timestamps to the data files.

This is the directory that holds the data for the liquid argon PMT study. 

This holds the data for the R&D runs that were performed May-August 2018. The PMT was ran at 1500V for all the runs excluding the last day of run1 where it was 1700V. The measurements during purification. For more detail on the Rig design please see: https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01884 . Below is a quick discription of the experiment and then the configurations of the runs. 

The Liquid argon rig was filled to ~90% full of argon, maintain a pressure of ~20 psig. The argon is held ina 20 litre vacuum jacket which holds a Hamaatsu R11065 PMT: http://lartpc-docdb.fnal.gov/cgi-bin/RetrieveFile?docid=441&filename=R11065_data_sheet_0903-1.pdf&version=1. The inner wall is surrounded by PTFE which has a TBP/Polythene mixture sprayed on. On the second run we added a Aluminium disk on the bottom which was coated as well. When purification system is not running the argon is allowed to vent out at ~2-2.5% per hour. It takes ~30-40 hours to completely evaporate. When the purification system is running the argon is past through a 3X molecular sieve 8-14 mesh beads and 3 kg of GetterMax-133 copper catalyst 3 Ã— 3 mm tablets. The argon then condensors through a liquid nitrogen condensor and falls back down into the dewar. 

The DAQ code that can be found in ./RunDir directory uses code created for the keysight DAQ for the GPM experiment. 

The analysis code can also be found in ./RunDir. This averages over the waveforms in the runs and fits to the waveform in serveral ways. There are also deconvolution algorithms that can be used in order to devconvlute the response to to the scintiallation signal from various cosmic particles.       

Run 1: There was issues with the solnoid valve so the pressure in the nitrogen system would build and not release. This was fixed for run 2 by purchasing a new valve. Runs were taken whilst purification was taking place. Background runs were taken at a threshold of 0.017 volts, whereas signal runs a threshold of 0.1 Volts was used. Runs had various event sizes and importantlyo the last day of running the PMT voltage (which is changed in the CAENHV directory) was set to 1700 volts. There was a significant amount of ringing in the data makign very difficult to perform deconvolution.  

Run2: The ringing was reduced by inproving the grounding connections and the wire connections. A Aluminium ring was painting with TBP and palced on the bottom of the Rig to improve light collection. Runs were taken whilst purification was happening. We ran overnight with good sucess but we used 126 liters of liquid nitrogen in 20 hours. Different gamma source were placed on the side of the PMT include colbolt-60 and Cecium-137 in order to see an increase in rate/ a spectrum. No spectrum was seen. The plan is to run with an LED and a CeI crystal in order to see if the PMT sees a spectrum and if so try with GaAr to with a Americium-241 source to see if the signal is see as it was in the GPM run. If not it assumed the TBP is too poor.
